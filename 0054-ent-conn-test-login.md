## 5.4 Test login via the Okta SSO

Let's test out the login!


**‚Å†Step 1:** If you are already logged in, logout first.   

**Step 2:** On the sidebar click on the "Organizations" dropdown and click on the Organization that you set up in the first section.

You should now be signed in to the organisation and redirected to your app.  


### Good job!
Now you have enabled SSO for an organization using their identity provider.
