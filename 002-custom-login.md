# Login page - UI Customization

## 2.0 Intro to Login UI Customization

In this task, we will customize the login page     


In this task, we will look at how easy it is to customize the CIC to fit the Toy Corners brand.      


You will learn how to customize the branding and design of the universal login page as well as how to localize the login page by customizing the texts used on the login page for different languages. **Let’s get started!**


## 2.1 Customize login UI

### 1. Add logo and primary color    

With Auth0’s No-Code Editor, you can style widgets in the New Universal Login experience to fit your brand. You can personalize the color, font, borders, and backgrounds of the widgets your customers see for login, password reset, authentication, and more.    

- Change the company logo. You can use an image from here: [Find a free logo on flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/search?type=icon&search-group=all&word=toy&license=&color=&shape=&current_section=&author_id=&pack_id=&family_id=&style_id=&choice=&type=icon)
