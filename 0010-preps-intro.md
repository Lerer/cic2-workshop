## 1.0 Intro to Okta B2B Customer Identity Bootcamp Lab

You are now all set up! It's time to set up your first application now.

Welcome to the first practical exercise of your Okta training course! In this exercise, we’ll be creating a single-page application (SPA) in Glitch which will act as the user interface (UI) for the learner. The SPA will use Okta CIC for user authentication purposes, and we’ll configure the Okta CIC tenant to provide authentication services using OpenID Connect (OIDC) for the application.

By the end of this exercise, you’ll have a customisable login to the SPA and the ability to view the JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) which contain the Access and ID tokens provided by Okta CIC.

**Let’s get started!**
