## 4.3 Manage users via the app as an Admin

In this section you will manage the users who are "members" of your organization

   
**Step 1:** Go to your Glitch application and login as an admin user into an Organization.      

⁠Here you’ll be able to do a number of things as an admin.

As you are an admin, you will be able to see a link on the sidebar **`Users & Roles`** which will take you to a user management page.

- Accept the invitation by clicking on the email (Open in an incognito or Private window)
- You will be asked to setup a password for the user.
